# Maze-Solver
Evaluation of a new multi-agent approach on maze problems based on the Q-learning algorithm

Abstract

The maze-solving problem consists of a system of paths on which,
given one starting position and one ending position, we should find the
shortest possible path that connects these. Reinforcement Learning
techniques such as those based on the Q-learning algorithm have already
been applied to this type of problems by creating agents that are capable of
learning how to best traverse these environments. However, no technique
seems to have been researched in regards to the use of two different agents
that could find this path jointly.

The following project introduces a new multi-agent Reinforcement
Learning algorithm based on Q-learning and the concept of the dynamic
goal state. This new approach is tested against the common single agent
model and an approach consisting of a maze solver and an explorer that
helps this explore the maze. The experiments performed show the potential
of this new approach along with some future work that may be required.
Along these benefits we highlight its greater adaptability for different types
of scenarios and its better performance for most of the performed
experiments.
